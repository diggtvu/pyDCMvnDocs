# Prompt Engineering for BIM Development

Master the art of communicating with Cursor AI to accelerate your Building Information Modeling workflows.

## Understanding Cursor's AI Capabilities

Cursor integrates multiple AI models to assist with code generation, completion, and problem-solving. Based on the [official Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/en/welcome), Cursor can:

- **Generate code** from natural language descriptions
- **Complete code** with context-aware suggestions
- **Debug issues** by understanding your codebase
- **Explain code** and provide documentation
- **Refactor code** for better performance and readability

## Core Prompt Engineering Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Contextual

#### ❌ Vague Prompt
```
"Create a wall function"
```

#### ✅ Specific BIM Prompt
```
"Create a C# Revit API external command that collects all interior walls 
on Level 1, extracts their wall type, thickness, and fire rating parameters, 
then exports the data to Excel with proper formatting and error handling."
```

### 2. Include Technical Context

#### ❌ Generic Request
```
"Make a script to process building data"
```

#### ✅ BIM-Specific Context
```
"Create a pyRevit script that processes IFC4 building models to extract 
space data including area, volume, and occupancy classification according 
to buildingSMART standards, then generates a compliance report for 
accessibility requirements."
```

### 3. Specify Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### ❌ Basic Request
```
"Get room areas from Revit"
```

#### ✅ Robust Request
```
"Create a Revit API function that safely extracts room areas, handling 
unplaced rooms, rooms with zero area, linked files, and design options. 
Include try-catch blocks for transaction errors and parameter access failures."
```

## BIM-Specific Prompt Patterns

### Revit API Development Prompts

#### Plugin Architecture
```
"Generate a complete Revit external command structure with:
- Proper attribute decorations for manual transactions
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Progress reporting for long operations
- Undo functionality
- Resource cleanup and disposal patterns"
```

#### Element Collection and Filtering
```
"Create a filtered element collector that finds all structural framing 
elements where the framing type contains 'Steel' and the element is not 
part of an assembly, with LINQ filtering for additional conditions."
```

#### Parameter Management
```
"Build a parameter utility class that safely reads and writes Revit 
parameters with type checking, handles shared vs instance parameters, 
and includes methods for parameter creation and validation."
```

### IFC Processing Prompts

#### Schema Navigation
```
"Create an IFC analyzer using ifcopenshell that traverses the spatial 
hierarchy from IfcProject > IfcSite > IfcBuilding > IfcBuildingStorey > 
IfcSpace and extracts classification data according to IFC4x3 schema."
```

#### Property Set Extraction
```
"Develop a function that extracts all Pset_SpaceCommon properties from 
IFC spaces, handles missing properties gracefully, and converts units 
according to the IFC model's unit assignments."
```

#### Model Validation
```
"Build an IFC validation tool that checks for:
- Missing required properties according to MVD specifications
- Geometric consistency between spaces and their boundaries
- Proper material assignments to building elements
- Compliance with local building information exchange standards"
```

### MEP Coordination Prompts

#### System Analysis
```
"Create a Revit MEP analysis tool that:
- Identifies all HVAC duct systems and their connections
- Calculates total airflow and pressure drops
- Detects undersized ducts based on CFM requirements
- Generates a system balancing report with recommendations"
```

#### Clash Detection
```
"Develop a clash detection algorithm that:
- Finds intersections between MEP elements and structure
- Categorizes clashes by severity and system type
- Excludes intentional connections and fittings
- Exports results with 3D view snapshots and resolution suggestions"
```

## Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

### 1. Incremental Development

Start with a basic structure and refine:

```
Step 1: "Create a basic Revit external command that displays a message"

Step 2: "Enhance the command to collect all walls in the active view"

Step 3: "Add parameter extraction for wall type and height"

Step 4: "Include Excel export functionality with formatting"

Step 5: "Add error handling and progress reporting"
```

### 2. Template-Based Prompts

Use established patterns:

```
"Using the standard Revit API transaction pattern, create a [FUNCTION] 
that [ACTION] for [ELEMENT TYPE] elements, handling [ERROR CONDITIONS] 
and providing [USER FEEDBACK]."

Example:
"Using the standard Revit API transaction pattern, create a family loader 
that batch loads structural steel families for beam elements, handling 
missing files and name conflicts and providing progress feedback to users."
```

### 3. Multi-Model Prompts

For complex scenarios:

```
"Create a federated model analysis tool that:
1. Loads architectural, structural, and MEP Revit models
2. Aligns coordinate systems using shared coordinates
3. Detects model inconsistencies across disciplines
4. Generates an interdisciplinary coordination report
5. Exports issues to BIM 360 or ACC for resolution tracking"
```

### 4. Performance-Optimized Prompts

Request efficient solutions:

```
"Optimize this Revit element collection for large models (10,000+ elements):
- Use appropriate filters before ToElements()
- Implement batch processing for parameter access
- Include memory management for large datasets
- Add cancellation tokens for user interrupt
- Implement progress reporting every 100 elements"
```

## Cursor-Specific Features for BIM

### Tab Completion Optimization

```
// Start typing common BIM patterns and let Tab complete:
FilteredElementCollector collector = new // Tab suggests complete pattern
using (Transaction trans = new // Tab provides transaction boilerplate
if (element.get_Parameter( // Tab suggests common parameters
```

### AI Chat Integration

Use the AI chat for complex questions:

```
"How do I handle circular references when traversing MEP system connections?"

"What's the most efficient way to update 1000+ family parameters in Revit?"

"Explain the difference between IfcSpace and IfcZone in IFC4 schema"
```

### Codebase Understanding

Leverage Cursor's project awareness:

```
"Based on my existing ElementUtils class, create a similar utility for 
handling MEP elements that follows the same patterns and error handling."

"Update all my Revit commands to use the new logging framework I've 
implemented in the Logger.cs file."
```

## Testing and Validation Prompts

### Unit Testing
```
"Generate comprehensive unit tests for this BIM utility function using 
MSTest framework, including:
- Mock Revit elements and parameters
- Edge cases like null values and empty collections
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Integration tests with actual Revit documents"
```

### Code Review
```
"Review this Revit API code for:
- Memory leaks and proper disposal patterns
- Thread safety issues
- Performance bottlenecks
- Compliance with Autodesk API best practices
- Error handling completeness"
```

## Common BIM Development Scenarios

### Data Migration
```
"Create a Revit model upgrader that:
- Migrates custom parameters from old to new standards
- Updates family symbols to current library versions
- Converts legacy dimension styles and text types
- Maintains element relationships and view assignments
- Generates a detailed migration report"
```

### Quality Assurance
```
"Build a model validation suite that checks:
- Element naming conventions against company standards
- Parameter completeness for COBie export requirements
- Geometric quality (overlapping elements, zero-length curves)
- View organization and sheet setup compliance
- Material assignment completeness"
```

### Automation Workflows
```
"Design an automated drawing production system that:
- Creates standard plan, section, and detail views
- Applies company titleblocks and sheet templates
- Generates schedules with standard formatting
- Exports sheets to PDF with consistent naming
- Updates revision tracking and sheet indexing"
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Always specify the BIM context** (Revit API, IFC, MEP, etc.)
2. **Include error handling requirements** in your prompts
3. **Request specific output formats** (Excel, PDF, IFC, etc.)
4. **Mention performance considerations** for large models
5. **Ask for documentation and comments** in generated code
6. **Specify user experience requirements** (progress bars, messages)
7. **Include compliance requirements** (building codes, standards)
8. **Request test scenarios** for quality assurance
