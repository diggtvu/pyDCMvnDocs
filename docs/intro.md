## What is Cursor AI?

Cursor AI is an **AI-native code editor** built specifically for modern development workflows. Unlike traditional IDEs with AI plugins, Cursor is designed from the ground up to understand your entire codebase and assist with intelligent code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

### Why Cursor Matters for pyRevit/BIM Development

BIM development with **pyRevit** and **Revit API** often involves:

- **Complex API integrations** with Revit's .NET framework
- **Extensive boilerplate code** for pyRevit tools and extensions
- **Domain-specific knowledge** for architectural and engineering workflows
- **Rapid prototyping** needs for custom Revit tools

Cursor AI excels at all of these because it:

- Understands **pyRevit patterns** and Revit API conventions
- Generates **accurate Python code** for Revit automation
- Creates **consistent documentation** following pyRevit standards
- Accelerates **tool scaffolding** and extension development

## ðŸŒŸ What You'll Learn
