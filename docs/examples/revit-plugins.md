# Revit Plugin Development Examples

Efficient Cursor AI prompts and workflows for Revit API development with real-world applications.

## Wall Analysis Plugin

### Efficient Cursor Prompt

**Prompt**: *"Create a Revit external command that analyzes all walls in the active document and exports their properties to Excel. Include error handling and transaction management."*

**Result**: Cursor generates complete wall analyzer with:
- Proper Revit API patterns
- Transaction handling  
- Excel export functionality
- Comprehensive error management

**DCMvn Use Case**: Applied in Munich Airport Terminal 1 (95,000 m²) for structural wall analysis and standardization.

## Room Data Extraction

### Efficient Cursor Prompt

**Prompt**: *"Generate a pyRevit script that extracts room data including area, volume, and level for all rooms in the project. Format output as a pandas DataFrame and export to Excel."*

**Key Benefits**:
- Cursor suggests proper pyRevit imports
- Generates room filtering logic
- Includes pandas integration for data processing
- Handles unplaced rooms automatically

**DCMvn Application**: Used for space programming analysis in healthcare and mixed-use projects like Zentralinstitut für Seelische Gesundheit (20,000 m²).

## MEP Systems Analysis

### Efficient Cursor Prompt

**Prompt**: *"Create a tool that analyzes HVAC systems in a Revit model, calculates airflow rates, and generates a compliance report for building codes."*

**Generated Capabilities**:
- Intelligent MEP namespace suggestions
- Duct and pipe system filtering
- Flow calculation algorithms
- Automated report generation

**DCMvn Expertise**: Leverages our multidisciplinary MEP coordination experience across 95,000+ m² of projects.

## Family Parameter Automation

### Efficient Cursor Prompt

**Prompt**: *"Develop a Revit plugin that standardizes family parameters across all families in a project, ensuring consistent naming conventions and data types according to company standards."*

**Features Generated**:
- Family loading and parameter scanning
- Standardization rule application
- Batch parameter modification
- Progress reporting and logging

## Custom Ribbon Integration

### Efficient Cursor Prompt

**Prompt**: *"Create a Revit ribbon panel with multiple commands for BIM coordination tasks including clash detection preparation, model validation, and export utilities."*

**Cursor Suggestions**:
- Ribbon panel creation patterns
- Icon and button management
- Command organization
- User interface best practices

## Real-World Project Applications

### Konzerthaus München (74,000 m²)

**Acoustic Analysis Plugin**
- **Prompt**: *"Create a BIM-integrated acoustic analysis tool that evaluates room geometries, material properties, and sight lines for optimal performance hall design."*
- **Application**: Concert hall acoustic optimization
- **Result**: Automated geometry analysis with material property integration

### Überseequartier Residential (419,000 m²)

**Multi-Building Coordination**  
- **Prompt**: *"Develop a tool for multi-building projects that synchronizes element naming, coordinates clash detection across buildings, and manages shared parameters."*
- **Scale**: 419,000 m² residential complex
- **Benefit**: Consistent standards across multiple building phases

## Advanced Plugin Patterns

### Model Validation Suite

**Prompt**: *"Create a comprehensive model validation plugin that checks geometry quality, parameter completeness, naming conventions, and export readiness for different file formats."*

**Generated Components**:
- Geometry validation algorithms
- Parameter completeness checking
- Naming convention enforcement  
- Multi-format export preparation

### Performance Monitoring

**Prompt**: *"Build a plugin that monitors Revit model performance, tracks file size growth, element count changes, and provides optimization recommendations."*

**Features**:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Historical data tracking
- Optimization suggestions
- Resource usage monitoring

## Cursor AI Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be Specific About Context**
   - ✅ "Create a Revit API tool for MEP clash detection"
   - ❌ "Make a clash detection tool"

2. **Include Technical Requirements**
   - ✅ "Export to Excel using OpenXML with custom formatting"
   - ❌ "Export the data"

3. **Specify Error Handling**
   - ✅ "Include try-catch blocks for transaction failures"
   - ❌ "Make it work"

### DCMvn Development Standards

Our team follows these practices across all projects:

- **Consistent Naming**: Use DCMvn coding standards in prompts
- **Documentation**: Request inline documentation for all generated code
- **Version Control**: Include git integration in workflow prompts
- **Testing**: Always request unit tests for critical functions

## Performance Optimization

### Large Model Handling

**Prompt**: *"Optimize the wall analyzer for large models with 10,000+ walls. Implement progress reporting, memory-efficient processing, and cancellation support."*

**Cursor Optimizations**:
- Efficient element filtering
- Batch processing strategies
- Memory management patterns
- User feedback mechanisms

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Transaction Management

**Issue**: "Transaction not started" errors
**Solution Prompt**: *"Fix transaction handling in this Revit plugin to ensure proper start/commit patterns with error recovery"*

### Parameter Access

**Issue**: Null reference exceptions
**Solution Prompt**: *"Add safe parameter access patterns with null checking and type validation for Revit elements"*

### Performance Bottlenecks

**Issue**: Slow processing on large models
**Solution Prompt**: *"Implement efficient element collection and processing for large Revit models with progress indication"*
