# Contributing to pyDCMvn

We welcome contributions to pyDCMvn! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- pip

### Setting up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyDCMvn.git
   cd pyDCMvn
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

### Making Changes

1. Write your code following the project's coding standards
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure all tests pass

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=pyDCMvn --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_dicom_reader.py
```

### Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with black
black pyDCMvn/

# Sort imports with isort
isort pyDCMvn/

# Lint with flake8
flake8 pyDCMvn/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy pyDCMvn/
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Naming Conventions

- Functions and variables: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

### Documentation

- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful
- Update README.md for significant changes

Example docstring:

```python
def enhance_contrast(image_array, method='clahe', **kwargs):
    """Enhance image contrast using various methods.
    
    Args:
        image_array (numpy.ndarray): Input image array.
        method (str): Enhancement method ('clahe', 'histogram', 'adaptive').
        **kwargs: Additional method-specific parameters.
    
    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Enhanced image array.
    
    Raises:
        ProcessingError: If enhancement fails.
    
    Example:
        >>> import pyDCMvn
        >>> enhanced = pyDCMvn.enhance_contrast(image, method='clahe')
    """
```

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Python version
- pyDCMvn version
- Operating system
- Minimal code example that reproduces the issue
- Full error traceback

### Feature Requests

For new features:

- Describe the use case
- Explain why it would be valuable
- Provide examples of how it would be used
- Consider backward compatibility

### Code Contributions

We welcome:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage improvements

## Vietnamese Healthcare Standards

When contributing features related to Vietnamese healthcare:

- Follow Vietnamese Ministry of Health guidelines
- Ensure compliance with local regulations
- Include appropriate Vietnamese language support
- Test with Vietnamese character sets
- Document Vietnamese-specific functionality

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Example test structure:

```python
import pytest
import pyDCMvn

class TestDicomReader:
    def test_load_valid_dicom_file(self):
        """Test loading a valid DICOM file."""
        dataset = pyDCMvn.load_dicom('tests/data/valid.dcm')
        assert dataset is not None
        assert hasattr(dataset, 'PatientName')
    
    def test_load_invalid_file_raises_error(self):
        """Test that loading invalid file raises appropriate error."""
        with pytest.raises(pyDCMvn.DicomReadError):
            pyDCMvn.load_dicom('tests/data/invalid.txt')
```

### Test Data

- Use anonymized test data only
- Include various DICOM modalities if possible
- Keep test files small
- Document test data sources

## Documentation

### API Documentation

- Document all public functions and classes
- Include parameter types and descriptions
- Provide usage examples
- Document exceptions that can be raised

### User Documentation

- Update getting started guide for new features
- Add examples to the examples page
- Update API reference
- Include screenshots for UI features
